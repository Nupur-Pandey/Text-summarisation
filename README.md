# Text-summarisation
Summer of Code Project
Throughout the development process, I provided feedback on the model's performance, suggest potential improvements, and help the team iterate on their approach to enhance the summarization capabilities of the app.
I assisted in developing and training the text summarization models. This involved implementing and fine-tuning machine learning models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformer-based architectures, depending on the team's chosen approach.
